# library_management_system_OOP(PRACTICE)

Create a system to manage books in a library. Users can add books, search for books by title or ID, and list all available books.

Book → id, title, author, isAvailable

Library → ArrayList<Book>, with methods:

    addBook()

    searchBookByTitle()

    listBooks()

    borrowBook() and returnBook()
